# ðŸ“¦ SPMS_G60 Project

## ðŸ“‚ Included Files
1. `Readme_G60.txt`
2. `SPMS_G60.c`
3. `SPMS_Report_G60.txt` â€” will be generated or truncated in the current directory
4. `Project_Report_G60.docx`
5. `test_data_G60.dat`
6. `demo_G60.mp4` â€” demonstrates how `test_data_G60.dat` is used to run the program

---

## ðŸ›  Compiling Process
```bash
gcc -std=c99 -o SPMS_G60 SPMS_G60.c
```
*(Uses the C99 standard on Linux Apollo)*

---

## ðŸ“‹ Assumptions
- Five members: `member_A`, `member_B`, `member_C`, `member_D`, `member_E`
- Three **lockers**
- Three **umbrellas**
- Three **batteries**
- Three **cables**
- Three **valet parking**
- Three **inflation services**

**Test Period:**  
- From **10 May 2025** to **16 May 2025**  
- Priority booking slots: **08:00 AM â€“ 20:00 PM**  
- One time slot = **1 hour**  
- Parking should have **12 time slots/day** for **7 days** to be filled in.

> **Note:** The project PDF on Blackboard states:  
> `"08:00 AM â€“ 08:00 PM. One time slot is an hour of time. That means parking should have 24 time slots a day and there are 7 days to be filled in."`  
> This appears to be ambiguous; our implementation uses 12 slots/day in the priority window.
